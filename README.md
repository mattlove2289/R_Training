### Overview of R

R is a programming language and software environment designed for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians, data analysts, and researchers for data analysis and visualization. R provides a wide variety of statistical techniques, powerful graphical capabilities, and is highly extensible with a vast ecosystem of packages available. R is open-source software, freely available under the GNU General Public License.

We use R for our ReSPOND dashboard and in the Data and Systems team for custom data requests. R is used for connecting to the Enterprise Data Warehouse, geomapping, and data manipulation. The main packages we use include `dplyr` for data manipulation, `sf` for handling spatial data, `tinygeocoder` for geocoding, and the `tidyverse` for a cohesive collection of R packages designed for data science.

### Training Session Overview

#### Objectives:
Understand the basics of R programming, learn how to work with different data structures in R, and gain practical skills for data manipulation and analysis.

#### Topics Covered:
1. **Introduction to R and RStudio:** Overview of R and RStudio IDE, setting up the R environment, basic R syntax and commands.
2. **Variables and Data Types:** Creating and assigning variables, understanding different data types (numeric, character, logical).
3. **Vectors:** Creating and manipulating vectors, accessing vector elements, basic vector operations.
4. **Data Frames:** Creating data frames, accessing and modifying data frame elements, basic data frame operations using `dplyr`.
5. **Lists:** Creating and using lists, accessing list elements, modifying lists.
6. **Basic Data Manipulation:** Subsetting data, filtering, selecting, and mutating data, using pipes (`%>%`) for streamlined data operations.
7. **Basic Data Visualization:** Introduction to base graphics and `ggplot2`, creating simple plots and visualizations.
8. **Creating Functions:** Writing custom functions in R, understanding function arguments and return values.
9. **Using Help and Documentation:** Accessing R documentation and help files, exploring additional resources for learning R.

#### What You Will Learn:
- **Foundational Skills:** Basic R syntax and commands, how to create and work with different data structures in R (variables, vectors, data frames, and lists).
- **Data Manipulation:** Techniques for subsetting, filtering, and transforming data, using `dplyr` for efficient data manipulation.
- **Data Visualization:** Basics of creating visualizations in R using base graphics and `ggplot2`.
- **Function Writing:** How to write and use custom functions in R.
- **Resources and Documentation:** How to use R's help system and find additional resources for learning and troubleshooting.

This training session will provide a solid foundation in R, equipping you with the essential skills needed for data analysis and manipulation. By the end of the session, you should feel confident in using R for your data analysis tasks.
