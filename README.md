# My R Analysis

## Introduction

This document outlines a simple R analysis example. The following sections include some introductory text and a basic R code snippet that demonstrates how to create a sequence of numbers and calculate their sum.

## R Code Example

Below is an example of R code that creates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 and calculates their sum.

```r
# Create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10
x <- 1:10

# Calculate the sum of the sequence
result <- sum(x)

# Print the result
print(result)
